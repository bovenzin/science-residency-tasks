Selected paper: Improving Subseasonal Forecasting in the Western U.S. with Machine Learning

### Summary

In this paper, the authors propose a machine-learning based system to predict the average temperature and
and total precipitation with two-to-four and four-to-six weeks advance. Their study responds to a challenge issued by national institutions in order to improve the accuracy of midterm forecasts, that are complicated beacuse they depend on both local weather and global climate variables
